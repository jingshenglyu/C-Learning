// Write a function, called distance, with three inputs and one output. 
// The inputs are velocity, acceleration and time. 
// The output is the distance traveled over the elapsed time. 
// The equation for calculating distance is:
// distance = velocity × elapsedtime + 0.5 × acceleration × elapsedtime × elapsedtime
// This quiz is not graded. You will see some test cases in the main() function to test out your code.
// To run your code, click on the "Test Run" button.
// A solution has been provided in the function.cpp so that you can compare your results.

// Program your Own Matrix Function
// Practice coding matrices in C++. In this exercise, write a function that has 
// two integer matrices 
// as inputs and then outputs the sum. Assume that the two input matrices have the same size 
// (e.g. matrix one is 5x3 and matrix two is 5x3).

// You can find an implementation in the solution.cpp tab if you'd like to compare your solution.

// You can use the Test Run button to run your code.

// TODO: Write a function that receives two integer matrices and outputs
// the sum of the two matrices. Then in your main() function, input a few
// examples to check your solution. Output the results of your function to 
// cout. You could even write a separate function that prints an arbitrarily 
// sized matric to cout.

// Question:
// Now it's your turn to make some programs with vectors. Here is a playground where you can write your program.

// Idea 1
// First, try writing a program that initializes a vector of size 3. 
// The values for this vector are [5, 10, 27]. Initialize another vector of 
// size 3 with the values [3, 17, 12]. Now subtract the two vectors from 
// each other and output the results.

// To get even more practice, write a function that takes in two vectors and then 
// outputs the difference between the vectors. Assume that the two vectors are the same size; 
// otherwise you would have to check that they are the same size and include some error checking.

// Idea 2
// Initialize a vector with the values [17, 10, 31, 5, 7]. 
// Initialize another vector with the values [3, 1, 6, 19, 8. 
// Then, output another vector that contains the product of each element. 
// In other words, the vector should have [17×3, 10×1, 31×6, 5×19, 7×8].

// To get even more practice, write a function that takes in two vectors and then 
// outputs a new vector that is the result of element by element multiplication. 
// Assume that the two vectors are the same size; otherwise you would have to check 
// that they are the same size and do some error checking.

//TODO: Use this as a playground to practice with vectors


//TODO:
// Fill out your program's header. The header should contain any necessary
// include statements and also function declarations


//TODO:
// Write your main program. Remember that all C++ programs need
// a main function. The most important part of your program goes
// inside the main function.
